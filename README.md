# TensorFly

This is an end-to-end-ish pipeline of an image recognition task using **transfer learning**, running on TensorFlow framework. This project is designed to be _lite_ (intentional spelling) for _fast prototyping_ (as if prototyping isn't fast enough). So I minimised touchpoints by abstracting them into make commands.

Not the kind of housefly but 'TensorFly' because I was training this on aeroplane images. I have also created TensorFood and TensorBug for classifying food and bugs respectively. These are on http://qwivel.com.

Prepare `data/`, `tf_files/`, `static/` folders

``` bash
make prepare
```

## 0. Download Libraries and Drivers

1. TensorFlow: `tensorflow==1.8.*`
2. [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
3. TensorFlow Lite: `tensorflow==1.7.*` (optional)
4. TensorFlow Mobile iOS:`tensorflow==1.1.*` (optional)

## 1. Download Data

1. Go to the `Queries` and enter your, you guessed it, Google queries, one for every line.
2. Edit `config/download.json` accordingly. By default, you will have 350 images for every class.
3. Run
    ``` bash
    make download
    ```
    This downloads your queries into folders of images in the `data/` folder.
4. Rename your folders.

## 1. Train Model

1. Edit model in `config/training.sh`. (Do note that to deploy your model in iOS, your architecture must not be too 'heavy'.)
2. Run
    ``` bash
    source config/training.sh
    make train
    ```
3. The above command also sets up TensorBoad to show the cross entropy losses. See http://localhost:6006.

## 2. Run Inference

Alas not TensorFlow Serving. Just a simple Flask app.

``` bash
make app
```

<!-- ## 3. Mobile Deployment (Optional)

Note that this only works if your model is MobileNet.

Note that the last line is specifically for deploying TF Mobile on iOS. To do this, create a conda environment with TensorFlow v1.1 installed, and call it `tensorflowmobileios`. Then:

```bash
source activate tensorflowmobileios
make train_tfmobileios
source deactivate
```

### Serialising the Graph

Serialise the `GraphDef` ProtoBuf file to give `optimized_graph.pb`. Last line is optional - quantising the ProtoBuf file to give `rounded_graph.pb`.

```bash
make optimise_pb
make quantize_android_pb
```

Alternatively, we can serialise the `GraphDef` to FlatBuffers, giving us `optimized_graph.lite`.

```bash
source activate tensorflowlite
make optimize_fb
source deactivate
```

### Android: TensorFlow Mobile

```bash
make optimize_pb
make export_tfmobile_to_android
```

### Android: TensorFlow Lite

```bash
make export_tflite_to_android
AndroidStudio android/tflite
```

### iOS: TensorFlow Mobile

```bash
source activate tensorflowmobileios
make train_tfmobileios
source deactivate
make export_tfmobile_to_ios
open ios/tfmobile/*.xcworkspace
```

### iOS: TensorFlow Lite

```bash
make export_tflite_to_ios
pod update
open ios/tflite/*.xcworkspace
``` -->

## Appendix A: Image Models in TensorFlow Hub

We're lucky to have a myriad of things to choose from: (a) model; (b) model version; (c) model size; (d) option for quantisation; and (e) dataset on which the model was trained on.

To use Inception V3 pretrained on ImageNet, set the following in `config/training.sh` before training.

``` bash
export MODEL="inception_v3"
export PRETRAINED_ON="imagenet"
export UPDATE_VERSION=1
export INPUT_WIDTH=299
```

ImageNet: ILSVRC-2012-CLS<br>
^The weights for this module were obtained by training on the iNaturalist (iNat) 2017 dataset, after pre-training on ImageNet.
